# Ashley Wright's Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to have a dedicated space where I could display all of the projects I have worked on in a clean and concise way that will also allow potential employer's to easily view my work. I learned a lot more about HTML and CSS and still know I ahve a lot of learning left to do. While the website looks very bare bones now, I am dedicated to working hard and working with my teachers to learn how to make it look even more presentable and aesthetically pleasing.

## Usage

You can view the page normally and click the links provided in the body of the webpage to take you to my previous projects. I also included links to my email, my GitHub, and my LinkdIn profile.

## Credits

I asked Xpert Learning AI for help on a couple pieces of code that was confusing me. I also went back and reviewed work we completed in class to remind myself of how to code certain aspects.
